While the candidate can parrot some correct technical terms, their explanations are vague, inconsistent, and lack specific details.  Their inability to answer questions about debugging, improvements, command-line argument handling, or handling of cycles beyond stating that their code \"already handles\" cycles is highly suspicious.

The absence of the code itself prevents a direct assessment of style or coding practices, but the interview strongly implies the responses are rote-learned or generated rather than reflective of genuine experience. The candidate's answers are too generic and lack the nuanced details a human with real-world coding experience would typically provide.
